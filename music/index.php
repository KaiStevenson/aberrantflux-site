    The following links lead to music I've recorded. Anything marked with # is improv or my own 
    composition. Anything else isn't my music, but is my playing. These recordings originate from
    one of two pianos: my 1903 Bechstein parlor grand or my Casio PX-S3000 digital piano.
    My digital piano can obviously record itself. For my acoustic piano, I either use my phone's
    voice memo app or my MXL990 microphone, depending on how lazy I feel.
    Any editing is done in Audacity or Ableton, though most of my recordings are posted raw.

    I've only played music since 2021, so I am very much an amateur! I enjoy some of my music
    and hope you will too, but I don't want to imply that I am in any way an expert.
