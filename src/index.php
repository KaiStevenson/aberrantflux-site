    This is my Web site for cool things, like my programming, music, writing, photography, and anything else I
    think of.
    I'm a student at The University of Victoria in Canada, though I try to find time to do things other than schoolwork. I also have another
    website you can visit at
    kaistevenson.com, if you don't like this one and want to hurt my feelings. You can email me at kai@kaistevenson.com.
